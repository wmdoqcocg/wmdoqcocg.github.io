This doesn't mean that once saved, we are automatically living the most fulfilling lives. Our Christian walk is a lifelong process of growth, learning, and choosing how to live our lives in honor of God (2 Corinthians 3:18). One way to examine whether or not we're building our lives on biblical foundations, is to evaluate what we base our worth and identity upon.\nWhy It Matters What We Build Our Lives Upon It might initially seem irrelevant to dwell on \"what\" our lives are built on, but our core beliefs greatly affect our day-to-day decisions and ultimately the trajectory of our entire lives. If we build our lives upon shaky ground, we risk a lot - including falling into destructive patterns which cause us and others pain, missing opportunities to impact the world for good, and lacking peace and contentment in our daily lives. However, when we establish a strong foundation, anchored in God's truth, we will experience His love, grace and strength as He transforms and guides us towards holiness. The implications of having a solid, biblical foundation are many, therefore examining this area of our lives is essential to spiritual health:\nGain a proper understanding of who we are in light of God's Word rather than being swayed by misleading cultural norms. Avoid making our happiness and self-worth dependent on worldly standards, material possessions, or human approval. Develop Christ-like character and godly wisdom resulting from a lifestyle grounded in scriptural principles and humble reliance on God. Experience freedom from unhelpful habits, compulsions, addictions, and sin patterns. Discern between God's calling and tempting distractions. Have the confidence to stand up for our faith and courageously share the Good News with others. Live in alignment with God's purpose for our lives. How to Test What Your Life Is Built On Examining the foundational blocks of our lives won't always be easy as it may bring unsettling realization that we've been clinging to some less-than-sound sources of security. Nonetheless, we can embark on this evaluation with hope in the transformative power of the gospel and the promise that God will lead us to greater maturity and fruitfulness in Him (Philippians 1:6). Here's a few ways to start testing the bases of your life:\nIdentify what matters most in your life. Note down the things, people, and ideologies that you deem most significant, and then ask yourself: are these based on God's word or subjective personal preferences, traditions or societal expectations? Reflect on what God's priorities are in the Bible versus what you've assumed to be important. Consider your sources of comfort and assurance. In times of struggle, where do you find your solace - in God or elsewhere? Determine the nature of your longings and how well they align with biblical truth. Evaluate your sense of identity. On which basis do you primarily base your self-worth and value - God's opinion of you as His beloved child, human achievement, physical appearance or popularity? Use these reflections to re-adjust your focus so that it's firmly fixed on God's perspective of you. Analyze your motivations. When you make decisions, are they ultimately moved by a desire to please God and love others or out of fear of missing out or personal gain? Acknowledge the areas you need adjustment in, repent and seek the Lord's guidance. Examine your patterns of communication with God. Do you view prayer as a dialogue where you bring all your concerns to him and listen for his response? Or, perhaps, does a subtle \"religious performance\" mentality cloud your heart; asserting the importance of the ritual more than the relationship with the Abba? True communion with Father God comes with transparent two-way communication. Ultimately, as children of God, let’s encourage each other to regularly evaluate the foundations of our lives. In doing so, we'll grow deeper in knowing, loving and walking waccording to God's truth, experiencing greater fulfillment and being a more effective witness to those around us.\n","wordCount":"673","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-27T03:45:36Z","dateModified":"2024-02-27T03:45:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wmdoqcocg.github.io/posts/48016175-why-should-christians-evaluate-what-their-lives-are-built-on/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Wmdoqcocg","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wmdoqcocg.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wmdoqcocg.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Wmdoqcocg (Alt + H)">Wmdoqcocg</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why Should Christians Evaluate What Their Lives Are Built On?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-02-27 03:45:36 +0000 UTC'>February 27, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Why It Matters What We Build Our Lives Upon">Why It Matters What We Build Our Lives Upon</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="How to Test What Your Life Is Built On">How to Test What Your Life Is Built On</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>As believers, we've received the wonderful gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (John 3:16).
