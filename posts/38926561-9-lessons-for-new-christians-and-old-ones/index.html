For some of us, that process may have been gradual or relatively simple. For others, it was quite challenging and difficult to comprehend. Yet no matter what our initial path to faith has looked like, becoming a Christian is an active step of surrender and commitment. It marks the beginning of a lifelong journey in which we deepen our understanding of who God is and walk closely with him.\nSince this new life in Christ is a continuous learning experience, there are always lessons to be gleaned along the way; regardless of how long we may have walked with Him already. Indeed, many can resonate with the Apostle Paul's proclamation: “We haven't reached spiritual maturity; we haven't yet achieved anything, really compared with what lies ahead” (Philippians 3:12-13, MSG). In light of this, here are a few timeless pointers to remind ourselves whether we have just started or are well into the pilgrimage as a follower of Jesus:\n1) Know and Understand the Basics. Being a new believer doesn’t mean you should remain that way forever - continue growing in your faith. You will need to spend time reading the Bible, listening to sermons, participating in fellowship, and asking questions. Leaving everything as is and not taking steps to grow only brings stagnation to our faith. You are adopted into God's family, and this new relationship offers far too much to remain idle or content in immaturity.\n2) Discover Authentic Spiritual Community. Christianity wasn't meant to be lived individually; it is a team sport. Link up with other people who believe in, and passionately follow after, Jesus. Find a small group, attend Sunday services, and engage in Bible study. There is strength and encouragement in walking together on this road called Christendom. The bible says in Hebrews 10:25, \"Not giving up meeting together, as some had taken to doing...but encouraging one another\" (MSG)\n3) Be Honest About Your Doubts. As new and old believers alike, we won't always understand everything scripture proclaims. However, embracing transparency with our questions and doubts - instead of burying them - allows God to meet us in our uncertainty. Let’s remember that nobody has everything figured out all at once.\n4) Don’t Compromise Biblical Truths. As society changes, it challenges our convictions. A primary reason we follow Christ is grounded in our belief in his teaching and commandments found within the Scriptures. To go against these teachings is to abandon our foundation, resulting in what the New Testament refers to as ‘unchristian behavior.’ We must anchor our convictions firmly to sound Biblical principles.\n5) Keep Praying, Even When It Feels Pointless. Some days our prayers might feel insignificant – not because they aren’t substantial – but due to our overstimulated world or detachment from the present moment. Often, however, in such situations the Lord uses those times when prayer feels most senseless, to show up in beautiful and powerful ways. Remember, He said he would never leave us nor forsake us, and that includes paying attention as we communicate with Him\n6) Foster Joy Regardless Of Circumstances. Life is not always ideal or easy for any of us. But as Christians, we know that God doesn't promise to fix every problem in this life - merely that, despite trials, we are not alone (Matthew 28:20). We must develop the resilient habit of finding joy in the midst of challenges, knowing we serve a good and sovereign God who is with us through it all.\n7) Always Keep Learning and Adapting. Someone once noted that Christianity isn’t a fixed set of doctrines but a living person – Jesus Christ. As such, our faith should be dynamic, adapting to new circumstances while continually growing in its depths. As the Lord continues to shape and mold us, our Christian life will never end up as a static picture. Instead, let us live vibrantly in our ever-deepening relationship with the One we call Lord.\n8) Lean Into the Comfort of Grace. The Gospel message - that Christ died for sins, reconciling us to God - means that we don’t have to strive to earn our keep in Heaven. God’s grace is sufficient for us (1 Corinthians 15:10). Though it’s tempting to think t he opposite, salvation by works could unravel the beauty of God’s unmerited love. The goal of our faith is not to 'tick off a checklist,' but to live in reconciled relationship with a gracious God.\n9) Equip Others for Their Journey. The Great Commission - a key mission statement of Jesus' disciples post resurrection - charges us with telling others about the transformative love of God. In fulfilling this task, we help others understand and embrace a relationship with their Creator – a responsibility both of reverence and joy.\nWhile we all start somewhere different, it’s always inspiring to encourage each other on our unique journeys! So let's spur one another on, stay humble and teachable, and watch God transform our lives together.\n","wordCount":"846","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-07T12:02:40Z","dateModified":"2024-03-07T12:02:40Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wmdoqcocg.github.io/posts/38926561-9-lessons-for-new-christians-and-old-ones/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Wmdoqcocg","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wmdoqcocg.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wmdoqcocg.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Wmdoqcocg (Alt + H)">Wmdoqcocg</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">9 Lessons for New Christians ...
