This is no light matter and needs to be addressed for true spiritual health and growth. This article will examine how guilt can creep in, often due to misunderstanding the great biblical paradigms of God's grace and our freedom in Christ. We will then work through some solutions, grounded in truth from Scripture, that help to restore our joyful trust in the Savior.\nThe Root Causes Let's explore where such feelings can arise. John MacArthur points out two root issues. Firstly, \"grievous error in understanding, believin, and embracing the doctrines of God's unmerited favor and our total forgiveness through the finished work of Christ.\" [1] When we lose sight of the profound truth that salvation is all by grace alone and nothing we do earns it, we slip into a self-effort mindset. Secondly, an imbalanced view of sin in our lives—either overlooking or denying its presence, or focusing solely on it instead of the cross—can lead to false conclusions about our standing with God. Let's consider the antidote for each deception.\n1. Regaining Grace Perspective The first deceptive delusion needs \"grace-counteracting,\" as MacArthur puts it. We're called to understand afresh the astounding doctrine of God's unconditional love towards us, based purely on Christ's finished work. Ephesians 2:8-9 \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works so that no one can boast.\" Here, Paul states both that nothing we do contributes to our salvation, and the ultimate purpose is to emphasize God's glory. Our standing before Him is guaranteed forever when we entrust our lives to His Son. This should spark immense joy, humility, and gratitude!\nLet's also read Romans 8, particularly verses 31-34, which affirms believers are more than conquerors in every situation due to Christ's powerful atonement. Hebrews 7:25 says Jesus is continually interceding for us, taking away any reason for us to fear losing God's favor. These passages reaffirm that Christians stand holy, righteous, and forgiven because Christ made it so.\n2. Balancing Sin Awareness with Gospel Truth Regarding our second concern, we need to remember right living naturally results from a changed heart (which happens at conversion), energized and empowered by the Spirit. It doesn't earn our salvation, though! The gospel, not a legalistic code, defines the Christian life. So while we must acknowledge our sinfulness, repent, and purposely grow in godliness, we must never let this become an idol or a means of earning God's love. Without the cross, such focus would leave us bound by a barbed wire of fear, unable to walk freely with Him.\nRecall God's words in 1 John 1:7-9. Yes, we admit sin, \"purify ourselves from al that is evil\" yet simultaneously, we rejoice in His complete forgiveness: \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.\" Essentially, we're neither defined by our failures, nor by our flawless efforts, but by the Savior's completed work and love that set us free. In other words, we strive to reflect our Source well, but our worth stems from whom we belong to!\nClosing Thoughts In conclusion, guilty feelings in a Christian aren't automatically indicative of growing spirituality, but couldmean a distorted view of God's love or a disproportionate focus on our failings. Understanding His sheer grace, the transformational work of Christ, and the significance of the empty tomb, as well as maintaining a balance between personal responsibility and humble reliance on the Savior, are essential for sustaining that peaceful and joyful heart God longs for us to cherish.\n","wordCount":"642","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-28T00:29:28Z","dateModified":"2024-02-28T00:29:28Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wmdoqcocg.github.io/posts/56878891-guilt-and-the-great-deception-in-the-christian-life/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Wmdoqcocg","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wmdoqcocg.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wmdoqcocg.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Wmdoqcocg (Alt + H)">Wmdoqcocg</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Guilt and the Great Deception in the Christian Life</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-02-28 00:29:28 +0000 UTC'>February 28, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="The Root Causes">The Root Causes</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="1.
