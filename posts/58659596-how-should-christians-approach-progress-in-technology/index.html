While there are many benefits that come with technological progress, it also raises interesting questions about how Christians should approach this phenomenon. Is new technology always a good thing or can it pose negative consequences as well? How do we find the right balance between embracing new innovations but guarding against potential dangers? Here, we'll explore the answers to these important questions through a Christian perspective on advances in technology.\nThe Potential Benefits of Technology It goes without saying that technology has greatly improved our quality of life, offering solutions to old problems, providing greater accessibility for people with disabilities, expanding our knowledge, and facilitating connections around the world. At their best, technological advancements empower us to better steward God’s creation and serve others more effectively. These benefits provide a compelling case for investing time, energy and resources into developing new technologies.\nHowever, not all technological development is inherently moral or Christian – it requires discernment to navigate its use and impact. In the Bible, Solomon reminds us, “Whoever flatters his neighbor is spreading a net for their feet” (Ecclesiastes 7:14). Likewise, some technologies may be developed with selfish motives or at the cost of exploitation or deception, which should give us pause.\nIn line with Scripture's warnings against greed and misusing our power (e.g., Mark 4:24-25), we as Christians must be intentional about examining the ethical implications and larger social impacts of technological developments. We need wisdom to evaluate both the potential pros and the possible cons of any new tech.\nPotential Dangers \u0026 Downsides With all the upsides that technology offers, it's vital to stay aware of its potential pitfalls. While issues aren't universal to all technology, some common concerns include privacy breaches, addictive behavior related to screen use, misinformation leading to societal division, unhealthy focus on productivity or material success, and the very real problem of widening socioeconomic gaps exacerbated by unequal access to high tech resources.\nJesus said, \"For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?\" (Mark 8:36a ESV). His question helps keep our priorities clear in evaluating the impact of new technologies. Ultimately, a balanced approach will hold onto the transformative potential of technology while upholding Christian values and ensuring it doesn't compromise human dignity and wholeness.\nWisdom-Based Engagement The Bible consistently emphasizes wisdom, practicality, and healthy balance. As we weigh whether a specific technological advancement is worthy of support, we must ask ourselves, our Christian community, and the wisdom of the age, \"Does this innovation enhance human flourishing and serve as a force for good in the world, or does it detract from it in significant ways?\" (Romans 12:2 could easily apply to the context of tech choices.)\nFurthermore, humility and an openness to learning from others across disciplines also form an essential part of a Christian engagement with technology. \"Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?\" asks Proverbs 26:12, \"Yet out of a multitude of men he has little understanding.” This counsel reflects the danger of technophilia—the assumption that having created a thing makes one automatically an expert in its impact upon society and morality. Many scientific and tech breakthroughs warrant interdisciplinary discourse involving ethicists, sociologists, and theologians to better understand their fallout and maximize the positive potential.\nCall to Stewardship Genesis 1:28 makes the call for humanity to exercise godly authority in caring for Creation. Technology can be instrumental in achieving this dare in areas like healthcare, climate change mitigation, and disaster response. It's crucial, then, to stay committed to leveraging new inventions for the common good, particularly toward the vulnerable and marginalized among us (Matthew 25:34-40).\nWe must remember that the most transformative technology is always faith rooted in love. Saint Teresa of Calcutta observed that \"technology and skills [alone] do not bring peace in the heart.\" Regardless of technological develo pments, the final end and measure of Christian living will always remain faith, hope, and love—rather than tech itself.\nConclusion As faithful followers of Christ, our approach to technological progress should strike a balance between joyfully harnessing new discoveries’ potential and mindful consideration of potential pitfalls. May we seek wisdom and rely on our Biblical foundation, asking God for guidance and discernment on how and when to embrace or resist particular technological advancements. Let's partner with scientis ts and ethicists, champion the common good over self-interest, and uphold the vision of love and peace in a digital era. In so doing, we adhere to the mandate to steward God's world thoughtfully, wisely, and lovingly for the flourishing of all.\n","wordCount":"775","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-06T17:32:46Z","dateModified":"2024-03-06T17:32:46Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wmdoqcocg.github.io/posts/58659596-how-should-christians-approach-progress-in-technology/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Wmdoqcocg","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wmdoqcocg.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wmdoqcocg.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Wmdoqcocg (Alt + H)">Wmdoqcocg</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How Should Christians Approach Progress in Technology?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-06 17:32:46 +0000 UTC'>March 6, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="The Potential Benefits of Technology">The Potential Benefits of Technology</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Potential Dangers & Downsides">Potential Dangers & Downsides</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Wisdom-Based Engagement">Wisdom-Based Engagement</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Call to Stewardship">Call to Stewardship</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>In our highly advanced society, technology continues to develop and affect every corner of life.
