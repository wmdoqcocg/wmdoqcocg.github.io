This article will explore the often misunderstood and misconstrued concept of self-care and offer suggestions for achieving a healthy balance in our lives. While God commands us to love our neighbors as ourselves and to have care and compassion for others (Mark 12:30; Galatians 6:2), He also created us with real needs. To function well as Christ-followers and to give our best to the people around us, we need to ensure that we are meeting our own needs adequately. With this balance in mind, let's consider self-care as a holy endeavor rather than an inherently selfish practice.\nEmotional and Physical Wellbeing Are Important It has become somewhat cliché to point out that \"we cannot pour from an empty cup.\" However, its truth underscores just how necessary it is for us to look after ourselves. When we ignore our emotional and physical needs, we burn out more quickly, not only physically, but mentally as well. When we feel overwhelmed or fatigued, our ability to approach each day (and the people within it) with a joyful spirit becomes increasingly difficult. Some may argue, \"But I am serving God!\" Still, there's a balance that must be kept for one cannot properly serve if their body and emotions have completely run down.\nAnd take heed, as even Paul—arguably one of the greatest apostles mentioned in Scripture—knew the importance of self-preservation. By his own admission, he had a thorn in the flesh, which he pleaded with the Lord thrice to remove. Paul's words, \"Lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelations...in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake\" (2 Corinthians 12:7–9), make it clear that God granted him the strength to overcome even the most significant affliction by ensuring the man knew his limitations. \"Enough,\" seems almost to be a whispered concession from the Father who does not expect us to do everything or endure every trial without any respite. After all, it is the nature of a good father to care for His children, to provide what they need to be strong and complete in Him.\nNeglect of Self-Care Damages the Ability to Serve Effectively When we fail to practice adequate self-care, we can experience higher levels of stress and anxiety. This leads to less patience and a short fuse in situations where we would prefer to exhibit kindness and understanding. We may find ourselves flying off the handle more frequently, growing impatient with spouses and/or children, or snapping at friends and colleagues over trivial issues. Over time, the pressures we feel without ample rest and a modicum of stress management can take its toll, leading to conditions such as depression, insomnia, and even serious illnesses.\nIn addition to negatively affecting our emotional health, neglecting our physical wellbeing may cause us to fall ill with recurring ailments, leaving us less able to meet life's demands, including the service of God within the spheres in which we influence for His Kingdom. Furthermore, our mental health can suffer drastically, resulting in lower coping skills, poorer self-esteem and an overall failure to thrive.\nAs we hone the art of self-care, our relationships grow stronger and we're better equipped to fulfill the callings given to us by God. Instead of feeling drained and disconnected from our families because we've been spreading ourselves too thinly, maintaining our wellbeing allows us to operate out of a place of wholeness and rest. The byproduct of restoring ourselves is that we become renewed in the power of Jesus Christ, walking in a closer relationship with Him. There, true faith expresses itself in serving others from the very place of overflow provided through self-care.\nThus, engaging in practices such as regular exercise, proper nutrition, setting aside quiet time for prayer and meditation, cultivating a connection with other believers for encouragement and support, getting ample sleep, and engaging in pursuits that foster happiness and contentment can ultimately help us meet the standards set forth in Scripture for glorifying God through our actions and attitudes. It is not selfish or unholy to respect and acknowledge the spiritual, emotional, and physical aspects of our being, as these things work in tandem to shape the whole individual who is reflective of Christ.\nConclusion God never intended His children to trudge unrelentingly through life without pause or the benefit of personal time to nourish our souls. He understands our human frailties, and while there may be times when we must shoulder heavy burdens for His name's sake, He also provides moments of reprieve. It's up to us to accept these opportunities when they come and recognize them as part of our ongoing walk with Him. If we consistently place self-care in its proper context of prioritizing the well-being of our spirits and our bodies while acknowledging the sanctity of every moment devoted to love and service—to God and others—self-care ceases to be thought of as an indulgence but as a holy endeavor.\n© 2018 Mel Lachoux Paszenrikke\nComments No omments yet.
