This paper underscores the importance of a conceptual shift from a defensive stance which tends to ring alarm bells only when there are clear infringements on religious rights, towards a proactive one where the church commits itself to nurturing a healthy and inclusive public sphere for all faiths and none. It will argue that by doing so, the church can not only preserve its place in the public sphere but also play a more significant part in promoting harmony between different religions as well as enhancing the notion of a truly common good. The focus of our discussion rests on the Western context, specifically the United States and Europe where these issues are particularly acute, given the challenges posed by the rise of nationalist populism.\n1. The Role of the Church in Defending Religious Freedom Church leaders have often defended the role of religion in the political sphere, asserting that unless the state recognizes the importance of the place of religion in the private and public life of citizens, liberal democratic societies will suffer deleterious effects. For many believers, religious identity is a fundamental aspect of personal liberty, crucial for the development of civic virtue and self-governance; indeed, certain versions of Catholic social teaching emphasize the need for individuals to ‘love God and neighbor’ – the first acting as a moral foundation for the second (D’Costa, 2014:59).\nOn many occasions, this has involved countering perceived hostility toward the church by highlighting religious persecution throughout history and invoking the principle of equality under the law, as enshrined in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR): “Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion”. In the U.S., the First Amendment guarantees the right to ‘free exercise’ and prohibition against any establishment of religion. However, the contemporary challenge goes beyond the preservation of existing freedoms: many religious groups are adapting to an environment characterized by multicultural and globalized dynamics. In this light, the church needs to actively promote values like tolerance and inclusivity.\n2. Taking Responsibility for Liberties and Freedoms: A Proposed Shift We suggest churches reframe their relationship with individual and collective freedom through a conceptual shift entailing two focal points. First, religion should no longer solely be conceived as a potential victim or even beneficiary of society at large but as a proactive player in fostering and nourishing the conditions for civil cohabitation. Second, and connectedly, religious communities need to cultivate a culture in which dialogue and self-critique take primacy over attempts to shield the faith from criticism as if it were self-evidently above reproach.\nThis does not imply an abandonment of religious identities or ideals; instead, it involves the affirmation of a particular understanding of those very identities and ideals. The aim of such a move is the fortificaton of the common good – the place in which public policy, cultural intercourse and communal values converge. From this perspective, religious freedom comes to denote not merely the protection of interior choice, but rather its external manifestations and their impact on the social fabric. It thus speaks to a broader commitment to inclusive solidarity and mutual respect in which all are responsible for the respecting the liberties and freedoms of others.\nIn line with the UDHR, this approach presumes that religious traditions should contribute to promoting and safeguarding the space for free and open expression, vigilant against discriminatory or exclusionary practices or rhetoric. As the Romanian Orthodox leader Patriarch Daniel has recently stated, “Christians must […] protect the rights and dignity of others, regardless of their ethnic or religious affiliation, be they minorities or majorities, both legally and morally.” (Ortho-Christiania, 2021)\nA sense of societal responsibility thereby entails the assurance that religious minorities and members of other faith or non-faith communities are heard, respected and made to feel part of a shared project based on common principles. To do so requires greater cooperation with state agencies and civil institutions in actively countering misinformation as well as fostering dialogue based on the understanding of difference as a constitutive feature of pluralistic societies.\nBy conceiving its mission in this way, religion aspires to act, not just as a well-defended fortress of defense or offense, but as a bridge for people with various beliefs and convictions to learn each other’s language and enhance respectful communication. Through a deep self-examination, we can encourage our congregants to think beyond their immediate contexts and encourage self-reflection about the possible unintended consequences of claims to liberty upon others.\n3. Conclusion The trajectory suggested here implies that religious actors become active and creative agents for change in their societies. They would commit themselves to ensuring a vibrant public sphere, where religious differences could be expressed, negotiated and debated. Acknowledging that the purpose of religious liberty and plurality is the pursuit of a more equitable society where individuals, groups and the state relate through an ethics of responsibility, churches and religious bodies would, in turn, benefit from a greater recognition of their pivotal role in this landscape.\nReferences: D'Costa, G.
